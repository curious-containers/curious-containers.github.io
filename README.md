# Curious Containers

This is the **Curious Containers** and **RED** documentation.

RED is short for Reproducible Experiment Description, a JSON or YAML based file format to describe data-driven experiments. A RED file allows researchers to share or publish their computational experiments, such that others can reproduce their results or customize the experiments to their liking. A minimal RED file consists of an application's commandline interface (CLI) description in Common Workflow Language (CWL) syntax, as well as CLI arguments and input file references.

Curious Containers provides a reference implementation of RED in Python (cc-core). Experiments can be executed on a local Linux host using the Docker container runtime via the FAICE tool suite (cc-faice). For a more advanced usage, the Curious Containers Agency (cc-agency) can distribute experiments in a Docker cluster across multiple hosts.

Together, RED and Curious Containers support the **FAIR** data principles for reproducible research. If you are new to the project, we advise you to work through the [RED Beginners Guide](red/guide).
