**This spec is currently under construction**

RED-CWL 1 is a subset of the CWL 1.1 standard, that is embedded in a RED file under the `cli` keyword.
RED-CWL is compatible with the CWL standard, such that the `cli` section can be extracted from a RED file and used with CWL runtimes like cwltool.

The first RED version, that will implement the RED-CWL 1 specification will be RED 9.
